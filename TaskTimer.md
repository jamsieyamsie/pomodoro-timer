# WebDev Final Project: TaskTimer

## What is TaskTimer?
TaskTimer is a dynamic and customizable study timer designed to make your work sessions more productive and enjoyable. It features seamless Spotify integration for background music and a built-in to-do list to help you track your tasks efficiently.

With TaskTimer, you can set your desired work and break durations to suit your schedule. Our quirky rice cooker mascot adds a touch of fun, gently vibrating as your timer counts down until the session ends!

During your breaks, you can choose between two engaging modes:
- Motivational Mode: Enjoy a series of random inspirational quotes to keep your energy and focus high.
- Entertainment Mode: Paste the URL of any video you want to watch, providing a personalized and relaxing break experience.

TaskTimer combines functionality with entertainment, making studying and productivity enjoyable and rewarding.

## Some Things I learned
- Create an animation for my rice cooker mascot that makes it vibrate faster as the timer decreases.
- Using iframe to import Spotify and video URLs.
- Random quote that changes and pops up at a set interval in motivational mode.

## Next Steps
- Add more break modes.
- Add a pause button for the timer.
- Add a back button from break mode.
- Make a cooler "Times Up" feature.
